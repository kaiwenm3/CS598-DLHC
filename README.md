Theis is the link to the repo of the code for the paper In-depth Benchmarking of Deep Neural Network
 Architectures for ECG Diagnosis: https://github.com/seitalab/dnn_ecg_comparison/tree/main

The dataset used for the paper can be downloaded under these links:
https://physionet.org/content/ptb-xl/1.0.3/ and
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bjoernjostein/georgia-12lead-ecg-challenge-database?resource=download

My attempts for the preprocess of the dataset are stored in preprocess.ipynb, but does not work.
utils.py was downloaded from the original repo from the paper.

My resnet18 model can be trained and evaluated directly by running resnet18.ipynb.
